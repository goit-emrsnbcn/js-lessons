/* 
Example 6 - Link formatting (includes and logical "AND")

Write a script that checks if the value of the link variable ends by symbol /. 
If not, append this character to the end of the link value, but only if link contains the substring "my-site".
Use construction if...else.

let link = 'https://somesite.com/about';
// Write code below this line

// Write code above this line
console.log(link);
